# IDMX 225 Project 2 Add Footer and Change CSS

You are going to have to clone the files from Project 1 into this repo. Once you do that, you are going to edit index.html and styles.css to make the required changes. You are expected to read your text as preparation for this assignment. Also you must use our CSS formatting rules from the CISY 225 Style Guide.

1. Download the clone of your completed Project 1 repo.
2. Delete the README.md file so it does not overwrite this one. 
3. Upload the rest of the files into this repo. 
4. Add a footer (with class footer) element to your HTML code. See the header element that is already there for an examlpe.
5. Add a copyright statement inside your footer using your name. See page 639 of your text to get the code for a copyright symbol.
6. Look at the picture in this repo's design folder. Make changes to the CSS to copy how the footer looks in the picture.
7. If all looks good upload files to your repo and commit to your master branch.

9. Go to [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/explore/?filter=most-used&time=month).
10. Select a fairly dark color (your choice) and take note of its RGB hex code. The best way to get to the hex codes is to select `Edit Copy`.
11. Change your CSS so that the "hero", "iama" and the "footer" classes are your chosen color theme.
12. Notice the line in the head that says:

`<link href='https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Source+Sans+Pro:300,400,600,700' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'>`

13. Search for "Google Fonts" on the Internet. Once in that page, use the top-right search for `Source Sans Pro`.
14. Add to your CSS file to use `Source Sans Pro` and if that isn't there, use the system `sans-serif` font.
16. Validate your html code and your CSS code. Check the formatting, making sure everything is properly nested.
15. Commit all changes to GitHub.
